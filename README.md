**Title: Paper Review - LLAMA PRO: Progressive LLAMA with Block Expansion**

**Abstract:**
This review critiques the LLAMA PRO paper, focusing on its innovative block expansion approach to address catastrophic forgetting in large language models (LLMs). The authors introduce LLAMA PRO, which achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks by fine-tuning expanded blocks while preserving the knowledge in inherited blocks.

**Key Points:**
1. **Summary and Contributions:**
   - Discusses strengths and weaknesses of LLMs, addressing catastrophic forgetting.
   - Introduces block expansion, extending the pre-trained LLAMA2 model to LLAMA PRO with 8 additional blocks.
   - Highlights improvements in coding, reasoning, and programming tasks.
